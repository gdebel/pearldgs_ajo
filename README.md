# pearldgs_toolbox_ajo

This repository hosts the Python functions that were created to develop the formula described in the paper "The PEARL-DGS formula : the development of an open-source machine learning-based thick IOL calculation formula" (Guillaume Debellemani√®re, Mathieu Dubois, Mathieu Gauvin, Avi Wallerstein, Luis F.Brenner, Radhika Rampat, Alain Saad, Damien Gatinel. *American Journal of Ophthalmology*, 2021). 

A Jupyter Notebook describing the whole development process is also provided, along with an example toy dataset working with the Notebook.


## Usage




```python
import foobar

foobar.pluralize('word') # returns 'words'
foobar.pluralize('goose') # returns 'geese'
foobar.singularize('phenomena') # returns 'phenomenon'
```
